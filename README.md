# 🔐 Strong Password Strength Evaluation - Cybersecurity Internship Task 6

This project is part of the **Cyber Security Internship** under the Ministry of MSME, Government of India. The objective is to understand what makes a password strong and evaluate its strength using online tools.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Understand the characteristics of strong passwords.
- Create and test passwords of varying complexity.
- Evaluate password strength using free online tools.
- Research best practices and common password attacks.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- [Password Meter](https://www.passwordmeter.com/)
- [Kaspersky Password Checker](https://password.kaspersky.com/)
- [NordPass Strength Checker](https://nordpass.com/password-strength-checker/)

## 📋 Task Steps

1. Create passwords with different complexity levels.
2. Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and length variation.
3. Evaluate each password using strength checkers.
4. Record and analyze feedback from each tool.
5. Identify key factors that affect password strength.
6. Note down best practices and tips.
7. Research common password attacks:
   - Brute-force
   - Dictionary
   - Credential stuffing
8. Summarize how password complexity improves security.

| Password         | PasswordMeter Score | Kaspersky Score | Remarks                                |
|------------------|---------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `tanmay123`      | Weak                | Weak             | Too simple, lacks complexity           |
| `Tanmay@2025`    | Strong              | Medium           | Better, but could be longer            |
| `T@nm@y_21#Rise` | Very Strong         | Strong           | Excellent mix of characters & length   |

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Passwords longer than 12 characters are significantly more secure.
- Avoid using names, dictionary words, or repetitive patterns.
- Use symbols and a mix of uppercase/lowercase letters.
- Use a password manager to generate and store strong passwords.
- Never reuse the same password across different services.
